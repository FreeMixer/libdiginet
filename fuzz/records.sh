# make fuzz-records: EVERY CHECK NAMES THE BUG IT CATCHES, AND CATCHES IT. Each abort() of
# fuzz/ carries in its comment one or more records, a one-line change of src/ or include/ and
# the seed it shows on
#
#   mutant: <path>:<line> `<old>` -> `<new>`
#   input: <seed of the harness's corpus>
#
# or one line `not a property: <reason>` for a stop after an allocation of the harness's own
# fails (fuzz/checks.awk reads them as OSS Verify's tools/check does). A check with neither, or
# with lines not of that form, turns this red before anything is built: the ratchet.
#
# Each record is then proved alone. The harness, plain and native, no sanitizer, driven by
# fuzz/standalone.c and linked against the library compiled the same way, exits 0 on the seed
# as the tree is; with the change made (`<old>` must occur once on that line) and the library
# and the harness built again it exits 134 on the seed, and the abort() it reached is the
# record's own, which each abort() of the harness names on stderr in this build. So is each
# patch of fuzz/sabotage/, applied alone: the seed its header names aborts at the check it
# names. The source is restored before each run and on every exit path. The count of records
# and patches met is the proof.
