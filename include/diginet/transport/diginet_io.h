 * libdiginet-transport: the wire under a session. A session never touches a socket or a
 * clock directly; it calls the three functions of a struct diginet_io. The packet socket is
 * one implementation, a socketpair or an in-process desk emulator is another, so every
 * behaviour of the session can be tested without hardware or privileges.
 *
 * Two kinds of packet socket: one bound to an interface (diginet_packet_open), driven through
 * struct diginet_io; and one bound to none (diginet_packet_open_any), which hears every
 * interface and sends out of the one a desk is on, driven by the desk mux (diginet_mux.h).
 * The second can be opened by a small privileged helper and handed to an unprivileged process
 * over a Unix socket.
